The president\\u2019s broadside against his predecessor coincided with a string of reports in conservative news media outlets that Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\\u2019s national security adviser, requested the identities of Americans who were cited in intelligence reports about surveillance of foreign officials, and who were connected with Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign or transition. Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\\u2019s intelligence agencies. The process of \\u201cunmasking\\u201d Americans whose names are redacted in intelligence reports, they said, is not the same thing as leaking them publicly. But Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the news media reports to bolster his case that he was targeted by the departing administration for political reasons. As the F. B. I. and congressional committees investigate contacts that associates of Mr. Trump had with Russian officials and business figures, the president argued that he was the victim of dirty tricks and that, if anything, it was associates of his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, who were doing the bidding of Vladimir V. Putin\\u2019s Russia. \\u201cSuch amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends,\\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early Monday morning in the opening burst of four messages aimed at Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats. \\u201c\\u2018Spied on before nomination.\\u2019 The real story. \\u201d In another post on Twitter later in the morning, he added: \\u201c@FoxNews from multiple sources: \\u2018There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented.\\u2019 @FBI\\u201d At his daily briefing later in the day, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he would not discuss the reports about Ms. Rice specifically. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we\\u2019re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,\\u201d he said. He chided reporters for showing more interest in the investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump\\u2019s team and Russia than in the conduct of Mr. Obama\\u2019s White House. Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama a month ago of tapping his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign last year. He has refused to back down, even though Mr. Obama and his top aides have adamantly denied it. The F. B. I. director and the former director of national intelligence have said the phone tapping charge is not true, and congressional leaders of both parties have said they have seen no evidence of it. In an interview broadcast on BBC on Monday evening, John O. Brennan, the C. I. A. director under Mr. Obama, chided Mr. Trump for making an unsubstantiated allegation against the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, has \\u201ca solemn obligation\\u201d to provide information \\u201cthat is accurate, that is measured and that is not just a spontaneous or impulsive number of words. \\u201d While other officials have said there is no convincing evidence so far of collusion between Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russian officials who meddled in last year\\u2019s election, Mr. Brennan said that \\u201cit would be premature at this time to make any determination, or rule anything out. \\u201d At the same time, he agreed with Mr. Trump about the seriousness of leaks to the news media in recent weeks. \\u201cThese leaks are appalling,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey need to stop. \\u201d In trying to combat what Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides see as a concerted campaign of leaks to undermine his legitimacy, the White House last month provided intelligence to Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, showing that the president or his associates may have been \\u201cincidentally\\u201d swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies last year. Since Mr. Nunes made that public, Mr. Trump\\u2019s team has focused on whether Mr. Obama\\u2019s White House improperly used that information. Republicans pointed to the reports about Ms. Rice on Monday. \\u201cSmoking gun found!\\u201d Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote on Twitter. \\u201cObama pal and noted dissembler Susan Rice said to have been spying on Trump campaign. \\u201d Intelligence officials are supposed to guard the privacy of Americans caught up in routine eavesdropping of foreign officials. In daily intelligence reports to officials like Ms. Rice, they typically refer to Americans who came up in recorded conversations as U. S. Person One or U. S. Person Two. But   officials, as Ms. Rice was, can ask intelligence briefers to provide names to better understand the meaning of the report. It remains unclear how many names were unmasked by Ms. Rice. But several former officials said she did so for legitimate reasons: The Obama White House was concerned during the election about continuing attempts by the Russian government to hack Democratic email accounts and interfere in the campaign. Ms. Rice, they said, needed to understand if Americans were involved in that. They also said Mr. Obama\\u2019s advisers worried during the transition  \\u2014   as he imposed sanctions on Russia for its election meddling  \\u2014   that the Trump transition team was trying to undermine American policy before coming to office. The content of the intelligence reports at issue remains unclear. Some officials have said the reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump\\u2019s family and inner circle before his inauguration. The former national security officials\\u2019 description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes\\u2019s characterization of the material, which he said was not related to the Russia investigations when he disclosed its existence. The White House and Mr. Nunes have not made clear whether they are concerned that actual names had been unmasked in reports, or whether one could tell who the person being discussed was from their context. But at least one name is known to have been unmasked: Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. He was selected for that post during American surveillance of Russia\\u2019s ambassador in December, when the two talked about the sanctions Mr. Obama had just imposed on Moscow. Mr. Flynn was forced out in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls. But Mr. Trump and other White House officials have suggested that the real problem in the Flynn case involved the leaks about his calls with the Russian envoy, not the content of the calls themselves  \\u2014   or what Mr. Flynn did or did not tell colleagues about his communications. Intelligence agencies are permitted to record calls even if they involve Americans, and any American citizen who talks with, messages or emails a foreign official under surveillance would be picked up by intelligence agencies. During the transition, this would have included Trump associates and even Obama administration officials.\",\n          \"As soon as the media learned Steve Bannon, one of President Donald Trump\\u2019s senior advisers, would no longer have a \\u201cpermanent seat\\u201d on the National Security Council, the headlines shouted he\\u2019d been \\u201cremoved,\\u201d \\u201cbooted,\\u201d and \\u201cdemoted. \\u201d[In fact, Bannon remains a close adviser to Trump, with top security clearance and an open invitation to attend NSC meetings.

The latest   of accusations began after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced late Saturday that he would push for legislation to bar Israelis from volunteering for national service with B\\u2019Tselem, an organization that focuses on allegations of human rights violations against Palestinians in   territories. On Friday, Hagai   the executive director of B\\u2019Tselem, addressed a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council devoted to a discussion titled \\u201cThe Settlements as the Obstacle to Peace and the   Solution,\\u201d referring to the internationally endorsed goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The session was initiated by the Palestinians and requested by five countries, including Egypt, a regional ally with which Israel signed a peace treaty in the late 1970s. Most of the world considers Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories that were conquered from Jordan in the 1967 war, to be a violation of international law. The Palestinians demand those areas as the heart of a future independent state, and continued Israeli building there has been a constant source of tension between Israel and the United States. Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s pronouncement was largely symbolic: Only three volunteers from a program for    exempted from compulsory military service on ideological, religious, health or other grounds have applied to perform national service at B\\u2019Tselem in the last seven years. Amit Gilutz, a spokesman for B\\u2019Tselem, said no other volunteers were in the pipeline. He described Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s ban as \\u201cspin\\u201d and \\u201ca distraction from the actual issues. \\u201d Yet it underscores the rawness of the political divide in Israel over the fate of the territories it seized nearly 50 years ago, the work of nongovernmental organizations that oppose the occupation, and the wedge that Jewish settlement there drives between Israel and the rest of the world. \\u201cAnything short of decisive international action will achieve nothing but ushering in the second half of the first century of the occupation,\\u201d Mr.   told the Security Council. Living under Israeli military rule in the West Bank, he said, \\u201cmostly means invisible, bureaucratic, daily violence. \\u201d Israel officially considers the West Bank disputed, not occupied, and it annexed East Jerusalem in a move that was never internationally recognized. Mr. Netanyahu denounced B\\u2019Tselem and Americans for Peace Now, a sister organization of the leftist Israeli Peace Now group, on Facebook. He said they had \\u201cjoined the chorus of besmirching Israel\\u201d and had repeated \\u201cthe mendacious claim that \\u2018the occupation and settlements\\u2019 are the cause\\u201d of the   conflict. He added, \\u201cThe truth is that the Palestinians have been attacking Israel for 50 years, since before a single settlement existed. \\u201d He described B\\u2019Tselem and similar organizations as \\u201cephemeral and delusional. \\u201d   Jerbi, the director of Israel\\u2019s National Civilian Service authority, told Israel Radio that B\\u2019Tselem had \\u201ccrossed a red line\\u201d by addressing the Security Council meeting and had carried out \\u201can act of betrayal. \\u201d Zehava Galon, a former executive director of B\\u2019Tselem who now leads the   Meretz party, which sits in opposition to Israel\\u2019s   government, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Israel \\u201chas needed to have the discussion about the settlements and the occupation for a very long time, because of the price the Palestinians pay but also because of the price paid by Israelis. \\u201d Responding to what it called Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s \\u201cslander,\\u201d B\\u2019Tselem said in a statement, \\u201cWe insist on saying loud and clear: The occupation is not Israel, and resisting it is not  . \\u201d Mr. Gilutz, B\\u2019Tselem\\u2019s spokesman, said that just as his organization did not take a position on the nature of the solution of the conflict, it was also not specifying what kind of international action should be taken. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a recent statement that \\u201cthe international community, including the United States, must completely and unequivocally boycott Israeli settlements. \\u201d The Israeli government has long questioned the patriotism of   groups that oppose its policies in the West Bank, and in July, the Knesset approved legislation requiring nongovernmental organizations that receive more than half of their financing from foreign governments to disclose that information in their publications, advertising and meetings with public officials. The   NGO law, which supporters said was intended to increase transparency, applies mainly to leftist groups critical of Israel\\u2019s policy toward the Palestinians, since rightist groups mostly receive private funding from abroad. The latest quarrel over B\\u2019Tselem arose after the Obama administration condemned the Israeli government in uncommonly harsh terms for approving plans to create a new Jewish settlement, three weeks after Israel signed a lucrative military aid package with the United States. The new housing was meant to accommodate settlers who are supposed to be evacuated against their will from the illegal settlement outpost of Amona by Dec. 25, by an order of Israel\\u2019s Supreme Court. After years of delays and legal wrangling, the pending struggle over Amona has put Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s government in a bind, and it has decided to petition the Supreme Court to put off the evacuation for an additional six months.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The president\\u2019s broadside against his predecessor coincided with a string of reports in conservative news media outlets that Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\\u2019s national security adviser, requested the identities of Americans who were cited in intelligence reports about surveillance of foreign officials, and who were connected with Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign or transition. Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\\u2019s intelligence agencies. The process of \\u201cunmasking\\u201d Americans whose names are redacted in intelligence reports, they said, is not the same thing as leaking them publicly. But Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the news media reports to bolster his case that he was targeted by the departing administration for political reasons. As the F. B. I. and congressional committees investigate contacts that associates of Mr. Trump had with Russian officials and business figures, the president argued that he was the victim of dirty tricks and that, if anything, it was associates of his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, who were doing the bidding of Vladimir V. Putin\\u2019s Russia. \\u201cSuch amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends,\\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early Monday morning in the opening burst of four messages aimed at Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats. \\u201c\\u2018Spied on before nomination.\\u2019 The real story. \\u201d In another post on Twitter later in the morning, he added: \\u201c@FoxNews from multiple sources: \\u2018There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented.\\u2019 @FBI\\u201d At his daily briefing later in the day, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he would not discuss the reports about Ms. Rice specifically. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we\\u2019re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,\\u201d he said. He chided reporters for showing more interest in the investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump\\u2019s team and Russia than in the conduct of Mr. Obama\\u2019s White House. Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama a month ago of tapping his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign last year. He has refused to back down, even though Mr. Obama and his top aides have adamantly denied it. The F. B. I. director and the former director of national intelligence have said the phone tapping charge is not true, and congressional leaders of both parties have said they have seen no evidence of it. In an interview broadcast on BBC on Monday evening, John O. Brennan, the C. I. A. director under Mr. Obama, chided Mr. Trump for making an unsubstantiated allegation against the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, has \\u201ca solemn obligation\\u201d to provide information \\u201cthat is accurate, that is measured and that is not just a spontaneous or impulsive number of words. \\u201d While other officials have said there is no convincing evidence so far of collusion between Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russian officials who meddled in last year\\u2019s election, Mr. Brennan said that \\u201cit would be premature at this time to make any determination, or rule anything out. \\u201d At the same time, he agreed with Mr. Trump about the seriousness of leaks to the news media in recent weeks. \\u201cThese leaks are appalling,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey need to stop. \\u201d In trying to combat what Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides see as a concerted campaign of leaks to undermine his legitimacy, the White House last month provided intelligence to Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, showing that the president or his associates may have been \\u201cincidentally\\u201d swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies last year. Since Mr. Nunes made that public, Mr. Trump\\u2019s team has focused on whether Mr. Obama\\u2019s White House improperly used that information. Republicans pointed to the reports about Ms. Rice on Monday. \\u201cSmoking gun found!\\u201d Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote on Twitter. \\u201cObama pal and noted dissembler Susan Rice said to have been spying on Trump campaign. \\u201d Intelligence officials are supposed to guard the privacy of Americans caught up in routine eavesdropping of foreign officials. In daily intelligence reports to officials like Ms. Rice, they typically refer to Americans who came up in recorded conversations as U. S. Person One or U. S. Person Two. But   officials, as Ms. Rice was, can ask intelligence briefers to provide names to better understand the meaning of the report. It remains unclear how many names were unmasked by Ms. Rice. But several former officials said she did so for legitimate reasons: The Obama White House was concerned during the election about continuing attempts by the Russian government to hack Democratic email accounts and interfere in the campaign. Ms. Rice, they said, needed to understand if Americans were involved in that. They also said Mr. Obama\\u2019s advisers worried during the transition  \\u2014   as he imposed sanctions on Russia for its election meddling  \\u2014   that the Trump transition team was trying to undermine American policy before coming to office. The content of the intelligence reports at issue remains unclear. Some officials have said the reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump\\u2019s family and inner circle before his inauguration. The former national security officials\\u2019 description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes\\u2019s characterization of the material, which he said was not related to the Russia investigations when he disclosed its existence. The White House and Mr. Nunes have not made clear whether they are concerned that actual names had been unmasked in reports, or whether one could tell who the person being discussed was from their context. But at least one name is known to have been unmasked: Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. He was selected for that post during American surveillance of Russia\\u2019s ambassador in December, when the two talked about the sanctions Mr. Obama had just imposed on Moscow. Mr. Flynn was forced out in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls. But Mr. Trump and other White House officials have suggested that the real problem in the Flynn case involved the leaks about his calls with the Russian envoy, not the content of the calls themselves  \\u2014   or what Mr. Flynn did or did not tell colleagues about his communications. Intelligence agencies are permitted to record calls even if they involve Americans, and any American citizen who talks with, messages or emails a foreign official under surveillance would be picked up by intelligence agencies. During the transition, this would have included Trump associates and even Obama administration officials.\",\n          \"As soon as the media learned Steve Bannon, one of President Donald Trump\\u2019s senior advisers, would no longer have a \\u201cpermanent seat\\u201d on the National Security Council, the headlines shouted he\\u2019d been \\u201cremoved,\\u201d \\u201cbooted,\\u201d and \\u201cdemoted. \\u201d[In fact, Bannon remains a close adviser to Trump, with top security clearance and an open invitation to attend NSC meetings.

The latest   of accusations began after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced late Saturday that he would push for legislation to bar Israelis from volunteering for national service with B\\u2019Tselem, an organization that focuses on allegations of human rights violations against Palestinians in   territories. On Friday, Hagai   the executive director of B\\u2019Tselem, addressed a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council devoted to a discussion titled \\u201cThe Settlements as the Obstacle to Peace and the   Solution,\\u201d referring to the internationally endorsed goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The session was initiated by the Palestinians and requested by five countries, including Egypt, a regional ally with which Israel signed a peace treaty in the late 1970s. Most of the world considers Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories that were conquered from Jordan in the 1967 war, to be a violation of international law. The Palestinians demand those areas as the heart of a future independent state, and continued Israeli building there has been a constant source of tension between Israel and the United States. Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s pronouncement was largely symbolic: Only three volunteers from a program for    exempted from compulsory military service on ideological, religious, health or other grounds have applied to perform national service at B\\u2019Tselem in the last seven years. Amit Gilutz, a spokesman for B\\u2019Tselem, said no other volunteers were in the pipeline. He described Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s ban as \\u201cspin\\u201d and \\u201ca distraction from the actual issues. \\u201d Yet it underscores the rawness of the political divide in Israel over the fate of the territories it seized nearly 50 years ago, the work of nongovernmental organizations that oppose the occupation, and the wedge that Jewish settlement there drives between Israel and the rest of the world. \\u201cAnything short of decisive international action will achieve nothing but ushering in the second half of the first century of the occupation,\\u201d Mr.   told the Security Council. Living under Israeli military rule in the West Bank, he said, \\u201cmostly means invisible, bureaucratic, daily violence. \\u201d Israel officially considers the West Bank disputed, not occupied, and it annexed East Jerusalem in a move that was never internationally recognized. Mr. Netanyahu denounced B\\u2019Tselem and Americans for Peace Now, a sister organization of the leftist Israeli Peace Now group, on Facebook. He said they had \\u201cjoined the chorus of besmirching Israel\\u201d and had repeated \\u201cthe mendacious claim that \\u2018the occupation and settlements\\u2019 are the cause\\u201d of the   conflict. He added, \\u201cThe truth is that the Palestinians have been attacking Israel for 50 years, since before a single settlement existed. \\u201d He described B\\u2019Tselem and similar organizations as \\u201cephemeral and delusional. \\u201d   Jerbi, the director of Israel\\u2019s National Civilian Service authority, told Israel Radio that B\\u2019Tselem had \\u201ccrossed a red line\\u201d by addressing the Security Council meeting and had carried out \\u201can act of betrayal. \\u201d Zehava Galon, a former executive director of B\\u2019Tselem who now leads the   Meretz party, which sits in opposition to Israel\\u2019s   government, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Israel \\u201chas needed to have the discussion about the settlements and the occupation for a very long time, because of the price the Palestinians pay but also because of the price paid by Israelis. \\u201d Responding to what it called Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s \\u201cslander,\\u201d B\\u2019Tselem said in a statement, \\u201cWe insist on saying loud and clear: The occupation is not Israel, and resisting it is not  . \\u201d Mr. Gilutz, B\\u2019Tselem\\u2019s spokesman, said that just as his organization did not take a position on the nature of the solution of the conflict, it was also not specifying what kind of international action should be taken. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a recent statement that \\u201cthe international community, including the United States, must completely and unequivocally boycott Israeli settlements. \\u201d The Israeli government has long questioned the patriotism of   groups that oppose its policies in the West Bank, and in July, the Knesset approved legislation requiring nongovernmental organizations that receive more than half of their financing from foreign governments to disclose that information in their publications, advertising and meetings with public officials. The   NGO law, which supporters said was intended to increase transparency, applies mainly to leftist groups critical of Israel\\u2019s policy toward the Palestinians, since rightist groups mostly receive private funding from abroad. The latest quarrel over B\\u2019Tselem arose after the Obama administration condemned the Israeli government in uncommonly harsh terms for approving plans to create a new Jewish settlement, three weeks after Israel signed a lucrative military aid package with the United States. The new housing was meant to accommodate settlers who are supposed to be evacuated against their will from the illegal settlement outpost of Amona by Dec. 25, by an order of Israel\\u2019s Supreme Court. After years of delays and legal wrangling, the pending struggle over Amona has put Mr. Netanyahu\\u2019s government in a bind, and it has decided to petition the Supreme Court to put off the evacuation for an additional six months.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panel\\u2019s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses. \\u201cThe ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,\\u201d said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel. She added, \\u201cI think I can be more effective on the outside. \\u201d Her departure will probably set off an intense political fight over how a new commissioner should be picked. By tradition, Senate Democrats would be allowed to select the replacement, but, by law, the choice belongs to the president, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Washington customs. The outcome could have a major impact on a commission long derided for inaction, even as record amounts of money have poured into campaigns. Spending during last year\\u2019s presidential and congressional races exceeded $6. 9 billion, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as \\u201csuper PACs\\u201d and other outside groups spent freely as a result of the Supreme Court\\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision. Mr. Trump can pick a nominee himself so long as he does not choose a registered Republican, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law scholar at the University of California, Irvine. The panel, which already has three Republicans, cannot have more than three members from any political party. Mr. Hasen said he would not be surprised if Mr. Trump made the pick himself, especially because his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was an election commissioner himself and has pushed fiercely for deregulating campaign finance. \\u201cIt would be transformative,\\u201d Mr. Hasen said, if the president nominated someone more aligned with the panel\\u2019s Republican members to push for even further deregulation. Mr. Trump has promised to \\u201cdrain the swamp\\u201d of special interest money in Washington, but his record so far has been mixed. While he claimed repeatedly during the campaign that he was \\u201c \\u201d his run, Mr. Trump and organizations supporting him took in nearly $600 million, and he put in far less than the $100 million of his own money that he had pledged. Since taking office, the president has strengthened some rules on lobbying by former members of the executive branch, but ethics experts have also criticized him for failing to fully disentangle himself from his vast financial interests. Ms. Ravel acknowledged she was concerned that Mr. Trump might seek to name her replacement himself. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m hoping that he will understand the need to appoint people who actually believe in the mission of the agency and will carry out the mandates of the law,\\u201d she said, but added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what will happen. \\u201d Her claims that Republican commissioners have been unwilling to rein in obvious violations and abuses have drawn wide attention  \\u2014   as well as angry rebukes from those Republicans, who have accused her of grandstanding and of exaggerating the problem. The publicity even earned Ms. Ravel an appearance on \\u201cThe Daily Show,\\u201d where her interviewer suggested the commission had become as irrelevant as male nipples. Ms. Ravel said she would return to California, where she had served as a state regulator in identifying millions of dollars in \\u201cdark money\\u201d that flooded California elections. She considered leaving the commission last year, she said, but decided to stay through the election after President Barack Obama had asked her to do so. While Ms. Ravel will be leaving only two months shy of the end of her term, commissioners have routinely remained well past the end of their terms because of the difficulty in agreeing on replacements. All the other current members are serving well beyond the end of their terms, with one Democrat, Ellen L. Weintraub, now nearly a decade past her term\\u2019s 2007 end date. Ms. Ravel plans to release an analysis her office has prepared on what she says is the worsening gridlock at the commission. The title sums up her feelings: \\u201cDysfunction and Deadlock: The Enforcement Crisis at the Federal Election Commission Reveals the Unlikelihood of Draining the Swamp. \\u201d By her analysis, the rate of deadlocked votes blocking \\u201csubstantive\\u201d enforcement actions against possible campaign violations has reached a new high of 37. 5 percent. And, in such cases, she said, financial penalties against campaigns have dropped significantly over the last decade. But, as with many issues at the election commission, Ms. Ravel and her Republican counterparts are sharply at odds over the panel\\u2019s performance. Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, called her analysis \\u201cnonsensical and arbitrary,\\u201d saying that deadlocked votes were actually far more unusual. Ms. Ravel has continued to push \\u201cthe tired meme of dysfunction\\u201d simply to make her political case, he said. His own data, he added, indicates that campaigns are complying with finance laws far more than before. Mr. Goodman suggested that \\u201ccontrary to the spin\\u201d from Democrats, \\u201cthe situation has indeed changed, but for the better. \\u201d\",\n          \"The blueprint for the Trump administration\\u2019s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday \\u201callows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding\\u201d in the State Department. [\\u201cThis would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,\\u201d the blueprint states.  \\u201cTaken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50, 000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,\\u201d a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. \\u201cAs long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,\\u201d the source adds. The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration\\u2019s \\u201csignificant funding of . . . [the] refugee program\\u201d defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign. Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the president\\u2019s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year. FY 2017 has proceeded differently. In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84, 995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities \\u2014  including refugee resettlement \\u2014  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017. Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date. During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30, 122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83, 292. In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7, 989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53, 018. To date, 38, 111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11, 899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trump\\u2019s 50, 000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6. On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his   decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked \\u201cdraft document\\u201d from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could \\u201cfire or remove. \\u201d In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson \\u2014  for one of the first times in American history \\u2014  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trump\\u2019s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the \\u201cspecific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]\\u201d in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. \\u201cThe Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule,\\u201d Chuang wrote in his decision. HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100, 000 in FY 2017. Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watson\\u2019s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program. As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday. \\u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,\\u201d President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court. President Trump\\u2019s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a president\\u2019s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28,  may well be something like this: \\u201cJudge Watson has made his decision now let him pay for it. \\u201d\",\n          \"Brock Turner, the former Stanford University student convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster on campus, described his actions as the product of a culture of drinking, peer pressure and \\u201csexual promiscuity,\\u201d according to his courtroom statement. In a letter he submitted before being sentenced to six months in jail by Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Turner said: \\u201cI am the sole proprietor of what happened on the night that changed these people\\u2019s lives forever. I would give anything to change what happened. \\u201d The case has spurred a national uproar because of a sentence criticized as far too lenient and a statement by the defendant\\u2019s father complaining that his son\\u2019s life had been ruined for \\u201c20 minutes of action. \\u201d The judge is also facing a recall effort and has received threats of violence to him and his family, an official said. The    victim read her own statement in court, recounting the horror of finding out details of her attack on the news (she had been intoxicated and could not remember the assault) and having to break the news to her family. Mr. Turner said the events of that night had left him \\u201ca changed person. \\u201d In addition to his   jail sentence  \\u2014   far less than the   maximum  \\u2014   he will serve three years\\u2019 probation and must register as a sex offender. He also lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford. In his letter, he said the woman had consented to the sexual encounter, even as he admitted \\u201cimposing trauma and pain\\u201d on her. He repeatedly cited an environment of peer pressure, drinking and promiscuity, factors he said he would use his time on probation to advocate against. \\u201cI want to demolish the assumption that drinking and partying are what make up a college lifestyle,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decisions hurt someone. \\u201d The woman passionately denounced his interpretation  \\u2014   especially his emphasis on alcohol and promiscuity  \\u2014   in her statement \\u201cAlcohol is not an excuse,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cRegretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault,\\u201d she added. \\u201cWe were both drunk the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately and run away. \\u201d The victim\\u2019s statement went viral after it was published last week by BuzzFeed. It was read live on CNN by the anchor Ashleigh Banfield on Monday. On Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that his wife, Chirlane McCray, and other figures would read the statement from Gracie Mansion in a video posted to his Facebook page. .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panel\\u2019s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses. \\u201cThe ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,\\u201d said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel. She added, \\u201cI think I can be more effective on the outside. \\u201d Her departure will probably set off an intense political fight over how a new commissioner should be picked. By tradition, Senate Democrats would be allowed to select the replacement, but, by law, the choice belongs to the president, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Washington customs. The outcome could have a major impact on a commission long derided for inaction, even as record amounts of money have poured into campaigns. Spending during last year\\u2019s presidential and congressional races exceeded $6. 9 billion, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as \\u201csuper PACs\\u201d and other outside groups spent freely as a result of the Supreme Court\\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision. Mr. Trump can pick a nominee himself so long as he does not choose a registered Republican, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law scholar at the University of California, Irvine. The panel, which already has three Republicans, cannot have more than three members from any political party. Mr. Hasen said he would not be surprised if Mr. Trump made the pick himself, especially because his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was an election commissioner himself and has pushed fiercely for deregulating campaign finance. \\u201cIt would be transformative,\\u201d Mr. Hasen said, if the president nominated someone more aligned with the panel\\u2019s Republican members to push for even further deregulation. Mr. Trump has promised to \\u201cdrain the swamp\\u201d of special interest money in Washington, but his record so far has been mixed. While he claimed repeatedly during the campaign that he was \\u201c \\u201d his run, Mr. Trump and organizations supporting him took in nearly $600 million, and he put in far less than the $100 million of his own money that he had pledged. Since taking office, the president has strengthened some rules on lobbying by former members of the executive branch, but ethics experts have also criticized him for failing to fully disentangle himself from his vast financial interests. Ms. Ravel acknowledged she was concerned that Mr. Trump might seek to name her replacement himself. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m hoping that he will understand the need to appoint people who actually believe in the mission of the agency and will carry out the mandates of the law,\\u201d she said, but added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what will happen. \\u201d Her claims that Republican commissioners have been unwilling to rein in obvious violations and abuses have drawn wide attention  \\u2014   as well as angry rebukes from those Republicans, who have accused her of grandstanding and of exaggerating the problem. The publicity even earned Ms. Ravel an appearance on \\u201cThe Daily Show,\\u201d where her interviewer suggested the commission had become as irrelevant as male nipples. Ms. Ravel said she would return to California, where she had served as a state regulator in identifying millions of dollars in \\u201cdark money\\u201d that flooded California elections. She considered leaving the commission last year, she said, but decided to stay through the election after President Barack Obama had asked her to do so. While Ms. Ravel will be leaving only two months shy of the end of her term, commissioners have routinely remained well past the end of their terms because of the difficulty in agreeing on replacements. All the other current members are serving well beyond the end of their terms, with one Democrat, Ellen L. Weintraub, now nearly a decade past her term\\u2019s 2007 end date. Ms. Ravel plans to release an analysis her office has prepared on what she says is the worsening gridlock at the commission. The title sums up her feelings: \\u201cDysfunction and Deadlock: The Enforcement Crisis at the Federal Election Commission Reveals the Unlikelihood of Draining the Swamp. \\u201d By her analysis, the rate of deadlocked votes blocking \\u201csubstantive\\u201d enforcement actions against possible campaign violations has reached a new high of 37. 5 percent. And, in such cases, she said, financial penalties against campaigns have dropped significantly over the last decade. But, as with many issues at the election commission, Ms. Ravel and her Republican counterparts are sharply at odds over the panel\\u2019s performance. Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, called her analysis \\u201cnonsensical and arbitrary,\\u201d saying that deadlocked votes were actually far more unusual. Ms. Ravel has continued to push \\u201cthe tired meme of dysfunction\\u201d simply to make her political case, he said. His own data, he added, indicates that campaigns are complying with finance laws far more than before. Mr. Goodman suggested that \\u201ccontrary to the spin\\u201d from Democrats, \\u201cthe situation has indeed changed, but for the better. \\u201d\",\n          \"The blueprint for the Trump administration\\u2019s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday \\u201callows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding\\u201d in the State Department. [\\u201cThis would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,\\u201d the blueprint states.  \\u201cTaken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50, 000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,\\u201d a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. \\u201cAs long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,\\u201d the source adds. The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration\\u2019s \\u201csignificant funding of . . . [the] refugee program\\u201d defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign. Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the president\\u2019s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year. FY 2017 has proceeded differently. In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84, 995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities \\u2014  including refugee resettlement \\u2014  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017. Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date. During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30, 122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83, 292. In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7, 989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53, 018. To date, 38, 111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11, 899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trump\\u2019s 50, 000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6. On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his   decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked \\u201cdraft document\\u201d from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could \\u201cfire or remove. \\u201d In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson \\u2014  for one of the first times in American history \\u2014  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trump\\u2019s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the \\u201cspecific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]\\u201d in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. \\u201cThe Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule,\\u201d Chuang wrote in his decision. HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100, 000 in FY 2017. Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watson\\u2019s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program. As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday. \\u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,\\u201d President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court. President Trump\\u2019s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a president\\u2019s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28,  may well be something like this: \\u201cJudge Watson has made his decision now let him pay for it. \\u201d\",\n          \"Brock Turner, the former Stanford University student convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster on campus, described his actions as the product of a culture of drinking, peer pressure and \\u201csexual promiscuity,\\u201d according to his courtroom statement. In a letter he submitted before being sentenced to six months in jail by Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Turner said: \\u201cI am the sole proprietor of what happened on the night that changed these people\\u2019s lives forever. I would give anything to change what happened. \\u201d The case has spurred a national uproar because of a sentence criticized as far too lenient and a statement by the defendant\\u2019s father complaining that his son\\u2019s life had been ruined for \\u201c20 minutes of action. \\u201d The judge is also facing a recall effort and has received threats of violence to him and his family, an official said. The    victim read her own statement in court, recounting the horror of finding out details of her attack on the news (she had been intoxicated and could not remember the assault) and having to break the news to her family. Mr. Turner said the events of that night had left him \\u201ca changed person. \\u201d In addition to his   jail sentence  \\u2014   far less than the   maximum  \\u2014   he will serve three years\\u2019 probation and must register as a sex offender. He also lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford. In his letter, he said the woman had consented to the sexual encounter, even as he admitted \\u201cimposing trauma and pain\\u201d on her. He repeatedly cited an environment of peer pressure, drinking and promiscuity, factors he said he would use his time on probation to advocate against. \\u201cI want to demolish the assumption that drinking and partying are what make up a college lifestyle,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decisions hurt someone. \\u201d The woman passionately denounced his interpretation  \\u2014   especially his emphasis on alcohol and promiscuity  \\u2014   in her statement \\u201cAlcohol is not an excuse,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cRegretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault,\\u201d she added. \\u201cWe were both drunk the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately and run away. \\u201d The victim\\u2019s statement went viral after it was published last week by BuzzFeed. It was read live on CNN by the anchor Ashleigh Banfield on Monday. On Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that his wife, Chirlane McCray, and other figures would read the statement from Gracie Mansion in a video posted to his Facebook page. .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panel\\u2019s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses. \\u201cThe ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,\\u201d said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel. She added, \\u201cI think I can be more effective on the outside. \\u201d Her departure will probably set off an intense political fight over how a new commissioner should be picked. By tradition, Senate Democrats would be allowed to select the replacement, but, by law, the choice belongs to the president, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Washington customs. The outcome could have a major impact on a commission long derided for inaction, even as record amounts of money have poured into campaigns. Spending during last year\\u2019s presidential and congressional races exceeded $6. 9 billion, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as \\u201csuper PACs\\u201d and other outside groups spent freely as a result of the Supreme Court\\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision. Mr. Trump can pick a nominee himself so long as he does not choose a registered Republican, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law scholar at the University of California, Irvine. The panel, which already has three Republicans, cannot have more than three members from any political party. Mr. Hasen said he would not be surprised if Mr. Trump made the pick himself, especially because his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was an election commissioner himself and has pushed fiercely for deregulating campaign finance. \\u201cIt would be transformative,\\u201d Mr. Hasen said, if the president nominated someone more aligned with the panel\\u2019s Republican members to push for even further deregulation. Mr. Trump has promised to \\u201cdrain the swamp\\u201d of special interest money in Washington, but his record so far has been mixed. While he claimed repeatedly during the campaign that he was \\u201c \\u201d his run, Mr. Trump and organizations supporting him took in nearly $600 million, and he put in far less than the $100 million of his own money that he had pledged. Since taking office, the president has strengthened some rules on lobbying by former members of the executive branch, but ethics experts have also criticized him for failing to fully disentangle himself from his vast financial interests. Ms. Ravel acknowledged she was concerned that Mr. Trump might seek to name her replacement himself. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m hoping that he will understand the need to appoint people who actually believe in the mission of the agency and will carry out the mandates of the law,\\u201d she said, but added, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what will happen. \\u201d Her claims that Republican commissioners have been unwilling to rein in obvious violations and abuses have drawn wide attention  \\u2014   as well as angry rebukes from those Republicans, who have accused her of grandstanding and of exaggerating the problem. The publicity even earned Ms. Ravel an appearance on \\u201cThe Daily Show,\\u201d where her interviewer suggested the commission had become as irrelevant as male nipples. Ms. Ravel said she would return to California, where she had served as a state regulator in identifying millions of dollars in \\u201cdark money\\u201d that flooded California elections. She considered leaving the commission last year, she said, but decided to stay through the election after President Barack Obama had asked her to do so. While Ms. Ravel will be leaving only two months shy of the end of her term, commissioners have routinely remained well past the end of their terms because of the difficulty in agreeing on replacements. All the other current members are serving well beyond the end of their terms, with one Democrat, Ellen L. Weintraub, now nearly a decade past her term\\u2019s 2007 end date. Ms. Ravel plans to release an analysis her office has prepared on what she says is the worsening gridlock at the commission. The title sums up her feelings: \\u201cDysfunction and Deadlock: The Enforcement Crisis at the Federal Election Commission Reveals the Unlikelihood of Draining the Swamp. \\u201d By her analysis, the rate of deadlocked votes blocking \\u201csubstantive\\u201d enforcement actions against possible campaign violations has reached a new high of 37. 5 percent. And, in such cases, she said, financial penalties against campaigns have dropped significantly over the last decade. But, as with many issues at the election commission, Ms. Ravel and her Republican counterparts are sharply at odds over the panel\\u2019s performance. Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, called her analysis \\u201cnonsensical and arbitrary,\\u201d saying that deadlocked votes were actually far more unusual. Ms. Ravel has continued to push \\u201cthe tired meme of dysfunction\\u201d simply to make her political case, he said. His own data, he added, indicates that campaigns are complying with finance laws far more than before. Mr. Goodman suggested that \\u201ccontrary to the spin\\u201d from Democrats, \\u201cthe situation has indeed changed, but for the better. \\u201d\",\n          \"The blueprint for the Trump administration\\u2019s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday \\u201callows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding\\u201d in the State Department. [\\u201cThis would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,\\u201d the blueprint states.  \\u201cTaken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50, 000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,\\u201d a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. \\u201cAs long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,\\u201d the source adds. The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration\\u2019s \\u201csignificant funding of . . . [the] refugee program\\u201d defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign. Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the president\\u2019s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year. FY 2017 has proceeded differently. In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84, 995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities \\u2014  including refugee resettlement \\u2014  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017. Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date. During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30, 122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83, 292. In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7, 989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53, 018. To date, 38, 111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11, 899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trump\\u2019s 50, 000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6. On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his   decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked \\u201cdraft document\\u201d from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could \\u201cfire or remove. \\u201d In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson \\u2014  for one of the first times in American history \\u2014  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trump\\u2019s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the \\u201cspecific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]\\u201d in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. \\u201cThe Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule,\\u201d Chuang wrote in his decision. HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100, 000 in FY 2017. Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watson\\u2019s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program. As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday. \\u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,\\u201d President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court. President Trump\\u2019s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a president\\u2019s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28,  may well be something like this: \\u201cJudge Watson has made his decision now let him pay for it. \\u201d\",\n          \"Brock Turner, the former Stanford University student convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster on campus, described his actions as the product of a culture of drinking, peer pressure and \\u201csexual promiscuity,\\u201d according to his courtroom statement. In a letter he submitted before being sentenced to six months in jail by Judge Aaron Persky of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Turner said: \\u201cI am the sole proprietor of what happened on the night that changed these people\\u2019s lives forever. I would give anything to change what happened. \\u201d The case has spurred a national uproar because of a sentence criticized as far too lenient and a statement by the defendant\\u2019s father complaining that his son\\u2019s life had been ruined for \\u201c20 minutes of action. \\u201d The judge is also facing a recall effort and has received threats of violence to him and his family, an official said. The    victim read her own statement in court, recounting the horror of finding out details of her attack on the news (she had been intoxicated and could not remember the assault) and having to break the news to her family. Mr. Turner said the events of that night had left him \\u201ca changed person. \\u201d In addition to his   jail sentence  \\u2014   far less than the   maximum  \\u2014   he will serve three years\\u2019 probation and must register as a sex offender. He also lost his swimming scholarship to Stanford. In his letter, he said the woman had consented to the sexual encounter, even as he admitted \\u201cimposing trauma and pain\\u201d on her. He repeatedly cited an environment of peer pressure, drinking and promiscuity, factors he said he would use his time on probation to advocate against. \\u201cI want to demolish the assumption that drinking and partying are what make up a college lifestyle,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decisions hurt someone. \\u201d The woman passionately denounced his interpretation  \\u2014   especially his emphasis on alcohol and promiscuity  \\u2014   in her statement \\u201cAlcohol is not an excuse,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cRegretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault,\\u201d she added. \\u201cWe were both drunk the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately and run away. \\u201d The victim\\u2019s statement went viral after it was published last week by BuzzFeed. It was read live on CNN by the anchor Ashleigh Banfield on Monday. On Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that his wife, Chirlane McCray, and other figures would read the statement from Gracie Mansion in a video posted to his Facebook page. .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
